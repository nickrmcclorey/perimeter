# Perimeter
This is a Java GUI that finds the shortest perimeter around given points.
You can create more points by clicking in the window and the perimeter will update accordingly.
I created this to familiarize myself with Java GUIs and to experiment with some geometry.
The reset button does not currently work.

## Compiling and running
You can use compile.bat and run.bat files to compile and run the program.
The .bat extension will allow you to run them from the command prompt and 
the headers inside the files should allow you to run them via bash on Linux.
